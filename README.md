# LoL Mastery Chest Client

Just a small application to let you view mastery chest information for
champions in your lobby. It is intended to be run alongside the LoL client.

As of right now, it was developed with the intention for it to be used in **ARAM**
as the mastery chest information is hidden (as of 15/01/2022), but turns out, other
gamemodes restrict this information too and so I've enabled it to work for
**Summoners Rift**. If you would like another mode to be supported, please make a 
feature request in the [issues](https://github.com/sabihismail/LoL-Mastery-Box-Client/issues) section.

### Built With:
- [LoL Client Java API](https://github.com/stirante/lol-client-java-api) - Handles 
LoL client connection and endpoint handling
- [TornadoFX](https://tornadofx.io/) - JavaFX UI framework for Kotlin
